# Squirrel, a coverage-guided DBMS fuzzer.
[![build](https://github.com/s3team/Squirrel/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/s3team/Squirrel/actions/workflows/build.yml)

`Squirrel` is a fuzzer for database managment systems (DBMSs).

`Squirrel` was first built on [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) and then migrated to [AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) to enjoy the improvement of state-of-the-art fuzzing strategies.

## Currently supported DBMSs
1. SQLite
2. PostgreSQL
3. MySQL
4. MariaDB

## Build Instruction (Run in docker, recommended)

1. Go to the directory of the dockerfile: `cd scripts/docker/xxx/`, where `xxx` is the database name.
2. Build the docker: `docker build -t xxx .`.
3. Run: `docker run -it xxx`.

## Build Instruction (Run on localhost)

### Prerequisite

For ubuntu 22.04:
```
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev cmake ninja-build clang pkg-config clang-format libpq-dev libyaml-cpp-dev
```

#### Build Squirrel
1. Clone this repo and run `git submodule update --init`.
2. `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Wno-dev`. If you want to compile only the mutator for the specific databases, add `-DXXXXX=ON`, `XXXXX` can be `SQLITE`, `MYSQL` and `POSTGRESQL`. `Mariadb` share the same interface with `MySQL`.
3. `cmake --build build -j`, the binaries are in `build/`.


#### Build AFLplusplus and DBMSs
1. Build aflplusplus: `cd AFLplusplus && make -j && cd ..`.
2. Use `afl-cc` and `afl-c++` to instrument your database.


### Run

#### Configuration

1. Set up a configuration file in `yaml`. Examples can be found in `data/*.yml`.
2. Set the enviroment variable 
```bash
export SQUIRREL_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yml
export AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_ONLY=1
export AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_LIBRARY= REPO_DIR/build/libxxxx_mutator.so
export AFL_DISABLE_TRIM=1
```

#### Normal Mode (SQLite)

Same as AFLplusplus: `afl-fuzz -i input -o output -- sqlite_harness`.

#### Client/Server Mode (MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL)

1. Dry run the database to get the `__afl_map_size` and set it to `AFL_MAP_SIZE`.
2. Run `afl-fuzz -i input -o output -- ./build/db_driver`, it will print the share memory id and wait for 30 seconds.
3. Start the databse server with `export __AFL_SHM_ID=xxxx`.
